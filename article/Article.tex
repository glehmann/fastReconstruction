\noindent
% The abstract should be a paragraph or two long, and describe the
% scope of the document.
Reconstruction by erosion and dilations are examples of interesting
and useful morphological algorithms are described as repeated
application of simpler filters until convergence is reached. While
such descriptions are concise and easy to understand they do not lead
directly to particularly efficient implementations.

This article describes the performance improvements when queue based
approaches described in \cite{} are used.
